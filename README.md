# INTRODUCTION: A MUST READ
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels.According to a report by WHO updated in June, 2021:

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally.

An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to heart attack and stroke.

Over three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries.

Although there are various kinds of cardiovascular disease like coronary heart disease(CHD), cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. But our main focus for this analysis will be CHD only.

Coronary heart disease is the term that describes what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the 
coronary arteries.

Over time, the walls of your arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits. This process is known as atherosclerosis and the fatty deposits are called atheroma.

Atherosclerosis can be caused by lifestyle factors, such as smoking and regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity.

You're also more at risk of getting atherosclerosis if you have conditions like high cholesterol, high blood pressure (hypertension) or diabetes.

Coronary heart disease cannot be cured but treatment can help manage the symptoms and reduce the chances of problems such as heart attacks.

### Treatment can include :

lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and stopping smoking, medicines, angioplasty – where balloons and stents are used to treat narrow heart arteries surgery.

# Problem Description

The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham,Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includesover 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

## So, where does machine learning fit it ?

Due to the multi-contributory risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and various others it gets very constrained to identify the risk factors for some of the patients. That's why we are turning to data mining and machine learning for predicting the disease to avert the risks.

Machine learning (ML), due to its distinction in pattern detection and classification, proves to be effective in assisting decision making and risk assessment from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry on heart disease.
